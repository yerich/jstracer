    Basically, your objectives in your objective list should be fairly
    short statements of the objective; you should provide additional
    details about your objectives in this section to clarify what you
    plan to do.

     Further, survey the important data structures and algorithms that
     will be necessary to achieve the goals, and (for ray tracing
     projects) lists the new commands
     that will need to be added to the input language.

     To  get  bold face: bboolldd ffaaccee wwoorrddss.  To get italics: _i_t_a_l_i_c
     _f_a_c_e  _w_o_r_d_s.   To  get typewriter font: typed words.  To get
     larger  words:  large  words.   To  get smaller words: small
     words.  The major commands are .IP (indented paragraph), .sp
     (line  space),  .br  (line break), .RS (start right indent),
     .RE (end right indent), \f (change font), \s (change size)
